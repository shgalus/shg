<H1>The ``Clockwise/Spiral Rule''</H1>
<H2>By David Anderson</H2>
<p>
There is a technique known as the ``Clockwise/Spiral Rule'' which enables
any C programmer to parse in their head any C declaration!
<p>
There are three simple steps to follow:
<ol>
<li>
Starting with the unknown element, move in a spiral/clockwise direction;
when ecountering the following elements replace them with the corresponding
english statements:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>
[X] or []
</dt><dd>
=&gt; Array X size of... or Array undefined size of...
</dd>
<dt>
(type1, type2)
</dt><dd>
=&gt; function passing type1 and type2 returning...
</dd>
<dt>
*
</dt><dd>
=&gt; pointer(s) to...
</dl>
<p>
<li>
Keep doing this in a spiral/clockwise direction until all tokens have been
covered.
<p>
<li>
Always resolve anything in parenthesis first!
</ol>
<h3>Example #1: Simple declaration</h3>
<pre>
                     +-------+
                     | +-+   |
                     | ^ |   |
                char *str[10];
                 ^   ^   |   |
                 |   +---+   |
                 +-----------+
</pre>
Question we ask ourselves: What is str?
<blockquote>
``str is an...
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
We move in a spiral clockwise direction starting with `str' and the first
character we see is a `[' so, that means we have an array, so...
<blockquote>
``str is an array 10 of...
</blockquote>
<li>
Continue in a spiral clockwise direction, and the next thing we encounter is
the `*' so, that means we have pointers, so...
<blockquote>
``str is an array 10 of pointers to...
</blockquote>
<li>
Continue in a spiral direction and we see the end of the line (the `;'), so
keep going and we get to the type `char', so...
<blockquote>
``str is an array 10 of pointers to char''
</blockquote>
<li>
We have now ``visited'' every token; therefore we are done!
</ul>
<h3>Example #2: Pointer to Function declaration</h3>
<pre>
                     +--------------------+
                     | +---+              |
                     | |+-+|              |
                     | |^ ||              |
                char *(*fp)( int, float *);
                 ^   ^ ^  ||              |
                 |   | +--+|              |
                 |   +-----+              |
                 +------------------------+
</pre>
Question we ask ourselves: What is fp?
<blockquote>
``fp is a...
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Moving in a spiral clockwise direction, the first thing we see is a `)';
therefore, fp is inside parenthesis, so we continue the spiral inside the
parenthesis and the next character seen is the `*', so...
<blockquote>
``fp is a pointer to...
</blockquote>
<li>
We are now out of the parenthesis and continuing in a spiral clockwise
direction, we see the `('; therefore, we have a function, so...
<blockquote>
``fp is a pointer to a function passing an int and a pointer to float
returning...
</blockquote>
<li>
Continuing in a spiral fashion, we then see the `*' character, so...
<blockquote>
``fp is a pointer to a function passing an int and a pointer to float
returning a pointer to...
</blockquote>
<li>
Continuing in a spiral fashion we see the `;', but we haven't visited all
tokens, so we continue and finally get to the type `char', so...
<blockquote>
``fp is a pointer to a function passing an int and a pointer to float
returning a pointer to a char''
</blockquote>
</ul>
<h3>Example #3: The ``Ultimate''</h3>
<pre>
                      +-----------------------------+
                      |                  +---+      |
                      |  +---+           |+-+|      |
                      |  ^   |           |^ ||      |
                void (*signal(int, void (*fp)(int)))(int);
                 ^    ^      |      ^    ^  ||      |
                 |    +------+      |    +--+|      |
                 |                  +--------+      |
                 +----------------------------------+
</pre>
<p>
Question we ask ourselves: What is `signal'?
<p>
Notice that signal is <em>inside</em> parenthesis, so we must resolve this first!
<ul>
<li>
Moving in a <em>clockwise</em> direction we see `(' so we have...
<blockquote>
``signal is a function passing an int and a...
</blockquote>
<li>
Hmmm, we can use this same rule on `fp', so... What is fp? fp is also inside
parenthesis so continuing we see an `*', so...
<blockquote>
fp is a pointer to...
</blockquote>
<li>
Continue in a spiral clockwise direction and we get to `(', so...
<blockquote>
``fp is a pointer to a function passing int returning...''
</blockquote>
<li>
Now we continue out of the function parenthesis and we see void, so...
<blockquote>
``fp is a pointer to a function passing int returning nothing (void)''
</blockquote>
<li>
We have finished with fp so let's catch up with `signal', we now have...
<blockquote>
``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an
int returning nothing (void) returning...
</blockquote>
<li>
We are still inside parenthesis so the next character seen is a `*', so...
<blockquote>
``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an
int returning nothing (void) returning a pointer to...
</blockquote>
<li>
We have now resolved the items within parenthesis, so continuing clockwise,
we then see another `(', so...
<blockquote>
``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an
int returning nothing (void) returning a pointer to a function passing an
int returning...
</blockquote>
<li>
<em>Finally</em> we continue and the only thing left is the word `void', so the
final complete definition for signal is:
<blockquote>
``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an
int returning nothing (void) returning a pointer to a function passing an
int returning nothing (void)''
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
The same rule is applied for const and volatile. For Example:
<pre>
	const char *chptr;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
Now, what is chptr??
<blockquote>
``chptr is a pointer to a char constant''
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
How about this one:
<pre>
	char * const chptr;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
Now, what is chptr??
<blockquote>
``chptr is a constant pointer to char''
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
Finally:
<pre>
	volatile char * const chptr;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
Now, what is chptr??
<blockquote>
``chptr is a constant pointer to a char volatile.''
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
Practice this rule with the examples found in K&amp;R II on page 122.
